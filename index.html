<P>


Most recently, we asked <a HREF="https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2407.16015">Wallcamera: Reinventing the Wheel?</a> 

</p> 

Several years after we published 
our <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3267359">Reactive Acoustic Jamming</a> technology (for Personal Voice
Assistants), it was reinvented as the <a HREF="https://cs.uchicago.edu/news/jammer-fc/">multiple-award-winning</a> 
"<a HREF="https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/jammer/">Bracelet of
Silence</a>" by University of Chicago. 


</p> 

Recently, we observed an interesting and strong <a HREF="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.14136">gender bias in password managers</a>, 
and wrote up <a HREF="https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03806">SoK: Acoustic Side Channels</a>.



</p> 

Earlier, Aurélien Bourquard and I were inventing <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05268.pdf">
Differential Imaging Forensics</a>. We started with asking <a href="ccspp51-yan.pdf">Who was Behind the Camera? </a>

</p>

In 2019, our SonarSnoop (active acoustic side-channels) was a finalist for the Pwnie Award for most innovative research. The citation was good fun to read:  <i>"Ok, you know we’re down when the paper reads like it is out of a James Bond book, or at least that in some dark corner of the NSA there is a scientist who’s pissed about it.  In this paper, the researchers use speakers to emit human inaudible sounds as part of a sonar system to track victim’s finger movements. Doing this while the victim unlocks their phone doesn’t give them the exact unlock pattern but does greatly reduce the number of patterns to try.  Straight off the sci-fi channel when it still played had sci fi shows, the only minor issue is they only tested it against 10 subjects and since it is an academic paper, it’s probably entirely impractical."</i>


</p>

<hr style="width: 50%; border-top: 1px solid red;">

I did my Ph.D. with <a HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14">Ross 
Anderson</a> in the 
<a HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/Security/">Security 
Group</a> at <a HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge
University</a>.

</p>

We started to work on usable security long before it's
so called. 

</p>
	
The work on <a HREF="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/TechReports/UCAM-CL-TR-500.pdf">
password security and memorability</a> I did with colleagues
in the 1990's (first published in 2000, and then in 2001 featured by 
Ross Anderson's book, <a HREF="https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SE-03.pdf">Security Engineering</a>) 
has been widely recognised as an early influential study in 
usable security, a currently booming field in both academia and industry. 

	</p>
	
I was a contributor to the first book on usable security, "Security 
and Usability: Designing Secure Systems that People Can Use" (edited by 
Cranor and Garfinkel, O'Reilly 2005), and served 
on the Program Committee for the first Symposium On Usable Privacy 
and Security (SOUPS'05, Carnegie Mellon). 
In 2014, I was given a (in fact, the first) 
<a href="http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2014/impact.html">
SOUPS Impact Award</a> in the USA for a paper I wrote in 2008. 
This award is presented every three years, recognising a 
paper that has had a significant impact on usable 
security and privacy research and practice.
</p>

My work on graphical passwords, 
<a href="bdas.htm">Background Draw 
a Secret </a> (BDAS) 
[ACM CCS'07]
and 
<a href="soups11.pdf">Shoulder-Surfing Resistant BDAS</a> (SSR-BDAS) [SOUPS'11], 
were selected by 
the Royal Society - the UK's national
academy of science - for their 
<a href="https://royalsociety.org/science-events-and-lectures/2008/summer-science/graphical-passwords/">
2008 Summer Science Exhibition</a>.
Since 2011, Microsoft has deployed
a version of BDAS in Windows 8 OS and its successors. 
On the offensive front, 
in collaboration with 
Ben Zhu (Microsoft Research), 
I've developed novel concepts and methods 
<a href="www13.pdf">[WWW'13]</a> <a href="ccs14.pdf">[CCS'14]</a>
for analysing the security of graphical passwords. Our methods
for the first time revealed severe security vulnerabilities in 
a major family of graphical password designs, which 
was extensively studied in the literature
before our work. 
We also developed the first method for generating 
high-quality 'graphical honeywords', 
successfully extending the notion of honeywords 
from text passwords (proposed by 
Ariel Juels and Turing Award winner Ron Rivest) 
to graphical ones. 
</p>


My work on the robustness and usability of Captcha (automated Turing tests), 
a standard Internet security mechanism, has led to highly cited papers (e.g.
<a href="acsac07.pdf">[ACSAC'07]</a>, <a href="ccs08.pdf">[CCS'08]</a>, <a href="soups08.pdf">[SOUPS'08]</a>,
<a href="ccs10.pdf">[CCS'10]</a>), <a href="ic12.pdf">[IC'12]</a>)
and influenced the system design of major companies such as Microsoft, Yahoo! and Google. Some technology developed by my team was licensed to Yahoo!. 
Invited talks were given at Cambridge, Cisco, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!, 
as well as to the <a href="http://www.m3aawg.org">Messaging Anti-Abuse Working Group</a> - this global industry consortium represented at the time nearly one billion mailboxes and considered my participation in their meeting "important in the global 
fight against online abuse". For this line of work, my duo team (with student 
Ahmad) was a finalist for a Times Higher Education award in the category of 
<i>the Outstanding Engineering Research Team of the Year</i> in the UK 
in 2009. A recent breakthrough was 
<a href="ndss16.pdf">a 
surprisingly simple, low-cost, generic 
but powerful attack</a> [NDSS'16]
that breaks a wide variety of Captcha designs (joint work with 
HC Gao et al).
</p>

Our work on <a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6775249">CaRP</a> [TIFS'14] 
proposed a new family of security 
primitives, and it was one step forward in the emerging paradigm of using hard AI problems for security, 
introduced by Turing Award winner Manuel Blum's team at CMU. CaRP addresses a number of security threats altogether, 
such as online dictionary attacks, relay attacks and cross-site scripting. 

</p>

More recently, NIST in the USA have revised part of SP 800-63-3 Digital Authentication Guideline, 
responding to our papers on <a href="ccs16.pdf">targeted online guessing</a> [CCS'16] and on 
<a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot16/woot16-paper-ruddick.pdf">PBKDF2 
cryptanalysis</a> [WOOT'16]. In 2016, my team won the <a href="https://www.acsac.org/archive/">best student paper 
award</a> at the 32nd ACSAC
(Los Angeles, USA), by <a href="acsac16.pdf">resolving an open security problem with deep learning</a>. 
Our NDSS'18 paper 
<a href="ndss18.pdf">
examined the honeyword algorithms designed by Juels and Rivest</a>, and we showed that they 
fail to deliver the claimed security level
by a large margin. 


</p>


I wrote a well-cited paper 
with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Randell">Brian Randell</a>
analysing <a href="acm_ng05.pdf">online game cheating</a>; was the first to  
argue that 
<a href="yan_acsac03.pdf">fairness enforcement</a> has emerged as 
the most important new security concern in online games.
I designed <a href="mb.htm">Magic 
Bullet</a> <a href="MB_ijcai09.pdf">[IJCAI'09]</a>, a dual-purpose 
game that people play online for fun 
but their gameplay resolves a problem that no computer 
algorithm can yet solve.  
I was the first to work on  
<a href="aaai10.pdf">collusion detection in contract Bridge</a> [AAAI'10] and 
<a href="nime06.pdf">aim-bot detection</a> in first-person shooters, and 
helped to launch NetGames in 2001, which has been 
a successful Int'l Workshop series on Network and Systems Support for Games.
</p>


I play Texas Hold'em, and have written a few peer-reviewed papers on poker, e.g. <a href="mps.pdf">Machiavelli as a poker mate</a>,
 <a href="plos1.pdf">gender biased deception</a>, and the <a href="tilting.pdf">science and detection of tilting</a>.  

</p>

My recent collaboration with Cambridge (2013-2017) 
looked into deception deterrence, with the 
aim to further the understanding of deception, which is not 
only the basic problem underlying security and cybercrime, 
but is central to human behaviour.
Interesting results on poker deception, insurance fraud and stock market are either published or in the pipeline - 
stay tuned! 

</p>



My research on graphical passwords, Captchas, targeted online guessing, poker and 
SonarSnoop have all received significant media attention. 
Major outlets such as 
BBC News, <a href="lsm.pdf">London Science Museum</a>, 
MIT Technology Review, 
Slashdot and The Economist
have featured our work.

 <a href="plos1.pdf">"To Bluff like a Man or Fold like a Girl?" - Gender Biased Deceptive Behavior in Online Poker</a> (PLoS ONE, 2016) shows that 
our experiment participants (poker players) bluff 6%
more frequently on average at tables with female-only avatars than at
tables with male-only or gender mixed avatars.  
This is a significant
effect in games involving repeated decisions.
To put it in perspective, casinos kick out of their premises anyone
who is able to obtain a marginal edge over the house, e.g. a 0.5% edge

Security Analyses of Click-based Graphical Passwords via Image Point Memorability</a>
(ACM CCS'14) introduces a novel concept and a model of image point 
memorability, with
both defensive and offensive applications. 
On one hand, we develop the first method for
generating high-quality graphical honeywords.  
The notion of honeywords was first introduced 
by Ariel Juels and Turing Award winner Ron Rivest
at CCS'13, but their algorithms only work with text passwords. 
On the other hand,
under our new lens, 
the effective password space of the  
state-of-the-art click-based graphical passwords
is actually weaker than 
its commonly believed strength by a factor of 2,048.  
Abundant room remains for researchers in security, computer 
vision and psychology to

A New Security Primitive Based on Hard AI Problems
</a>
(IEEE Trans. on Information Forensics and Security, v9 no.6, 2014)  
introduces CaRP, a new family of security primitives that 
address a number of security threats altogether, such as online 
dictionary attacks, relay attacks and cross-site scripting.
Our work is one step forward in the paradigm of
using hard AI problems for security, which was 
introduced by Turing Award winner Manuel Blum's team
at CMU.

<H2>Research Summary</H2>

<p>
I am interested in most aspects of computer and network security, both 
theoretical and practical, and my recent work focuses on systems security, 
including human aspects of security (e.g. usable security). My previous 
contributions illustrate both my 
view of security and research methodology. Namely, security fails not only 
because of the lack or failure of technical mechanisms, but also because of 
failures of other issues such as usability and motivation, and therefore an 
interdisciplinary approach is needed to tackle (many) security problems.

<h3> Usable Security</h3> </center>

<A name=exp>
<H4>Password memorability and security</H4></A>
Passwords are one good example of the importance of the human factors and 
usability in security.

In this work, carried
out in collaboration with 
a psychologist, we tackled an old but fundamental security problem - how do 
you train users to choose passwords that are easy to remember but hard to 
guess? There's a lot of "folk wisdom" on this subject but little that would 
pass muster by the standards of applied psychology. We did a randomized 
controlled trial with four hundred of our first year science students, and 
produced solid empirical results.
While confirming some widely held folk beliefs about passwords, we observed 
a number of phenomena which run counter to the established wisdom.

<HR><CENTER><H3>Incentive-compatible security</H3></CENTER>
Failure of motivation also leads to security failure. 
Incentive compatible security design, as an emerging research topic, appears 
to be essential in an autonomous network environment like the Internet where
many parties (or agents) involved are selfish. 

<A name=xeno>
<H4>XenoService</H4></A>

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) is at heart a manifestation of what 
economists call the "tragedy of the commons": while everyone may have an 
interest in protecting a shared resource (Internet security), individuals have 
a stronger motive to cheat (connecting insecure computers). Most of the 
proposed technical countermeasures would not work, as they didn't consider the 
incentive issue. We propose the XenoService as a distributed remedy to 
DDoS attacks which can be deployed in such a way as to provide effective 
economic incentives for the principals to behave properly.

<P><A name=game><H4>Security for network games</H4></A>The emergence of online games has fundamentally changed the traditional 
security requirement for computer games, which was mainly copy protection. 
Although online games share many security issues that other
networked E-commerce applications concern, e.g., payment security
and service availability, some unique characteristics of online
game systems impose interesting and challenging new security
requirements, which call for the novel use of existing
technology and the invention of new techniques.
While online games are developing into a multi-billion dollar
business, their security has recently started to attract researchers' attention.

<H4>Proactive password checking and password protocols</H4></A>In this work, we attack the classical proactive password checking method, 
which is 
based on dictionary attack and often fails to prevent some weak passwords with 
low entropy. A new approach is proposed to deal with this new class of weak 
passwords by (roughly) measuring entropy. A simple example is given to exploit 
effective patterns to prevent low-entropy passwords as the first step of 
entropy-based proactive checking. We also argue why strong password 
authentication protocols like EKE, SRP cannot replace proactive checking, 
responding to Wu's proposal in NDSS'99.

<H4>Denial of Service</H4></A>
Although denial of service (DoS) attack has become a fast-growing 
concern in security research, previous work focused on a type of classical 
service denial caused by resource exhaustion. We look into the DoS problem 
(including distributed DoS) from some new angles.

PBKDF2 is a popular crypto primitive and widely used in 
real systems such as Wi-Fi, Microsoft .NET, Cisco IOS and Apple's OS X.
Cracking PBKDF2 with GPGPU is not news, but we will have something interesting
to share here soon.

<A name=tt><H4>Traitor tracing</H4></A>
Traitor tracing is an emerging but promising 
cryptographic method introduced 
to combat copyright piracy of digital media, e.g. pay-TV. One threat model 
considered by researchers is that traitors, who are subscribed users in a 
content distribution system, build pirate decoders with their legitimate 
decoding keys to bypass the security mechanism of the system. Many schemes 
were proposed to catch traitors who leak their keys, and some
supported a black-box tracing paradigm. In this work, we show that a type of 
intelligent self-protecting pirate decoder can defeat many black-box 
traitor-tracing schemes.
